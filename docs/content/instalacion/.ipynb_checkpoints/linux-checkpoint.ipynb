    "Once you've added content and configured your book, it's time to\n",
    "build the HTML for each **page** of your book. We'll use the\n",
    "`jupyter-book build` command-line tool for this. In the _next step_,\n",
    "we'll stitch these HTML pages into a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build the HTML for each page, you should have followed the steps\n",
    "in [creating your Jupyter Book structure](02_create.html). You should have\n",
    "a Jupyter Book structure in a local folder on your computer, a collection\n",
    "of notebook/markdown files in your `content/` folder, a `_data/toc.yml` file\n",
    "that defines the structure of your book, and any configuration you'd like\n",
    "in the `config.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build each page's HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your book's content is in the `content/` folder and you've\n",
    "defined your book's structure in `_data/toc.yml`, you can build\n",
    "the HTML for each page of your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do so by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter-book build mybookname/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the links specified in the `_data/toc.yml` file (pointing to files in `/content/`) and\n",
    "  do the following:\n",
    "  * Run `nbconvert` to turn the content files (e.g., `.ipynb`, `.md`, etc) files into HTML\n",
    "  * Replace relative image file paths so that they work on your new built book\n",
    "  * Place all these generated files in the `mybookname/_build/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step is finished, you should have a collection of HTML files in your\n",

    "### Page HTML caching\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Jupyter Book will only build the HTML for pages that have\n",
    "been updated since the last time you built the book. This helps reduce the\n",
    "amount of unnecessary time needed to build your book. If you'd like to\n",
    "force Jupyter Book to re-build a particular page, you can either edit the\n",
    "corresponding file in the `content/` folder, or delete that page's HTML\n",
    "in the `_build/` folder.\n",

    "## Create an *online* repository for your book\n",
    "\n",
    "You've created your book on your own computer, but you haven't yet added it\n",

    "and to add your book's content to it. In this case, we'll use GitHub-Pages\n",
    "to build the HTML for your book. However, you can also build the book's HTML\n",
    "manually. Both will be covered in [building and publishing your book](04_publish.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, log-in to GitHub, then go to the \"create a new repository\" page:\n",
    "\n",
    "   https://github.com/new\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, add a name and description for your book. You can choose whatever\n",
    "   initialization you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, clone the empty repository to your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/<my-org>/<my-book-name>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Copy all of your book files and folders (what was created when you ran `jupyter-book create mybook`)\n",
    "   into the new repository. For example, if you created your book locally with `jupyter-book create mylocalbook`\n",
    "   and your online repository is called `myonlinebook`, the command would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp -r mylocalbook/* myonlinebook/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will copy over the local book files into the online book folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit the new files to the repository in `myonlinebook/`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd myonlinebook\n",
    "   git add ./*\n",
    "   git commit -m \"adding my first book!\"\n",
    "   git push\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next step: build your book\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created the HTML for each page of your book, it's time\n",
    "to stitch them together into a book. That's covered in the next section."
